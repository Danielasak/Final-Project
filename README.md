# **Coordinating swarms of drones and base stations**


**Students**: Yarin Abutbul and Daniela Sak.

**Advisors**: Prof Michael Segal

### **Abstract Information**

In the recent years the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has increased for various purposes, such as providing service to ground mobile users and so the need to coordinate efficiently the UAVs with the base stations.
The real-time limitations of the UAV is a limited coverage range and a limited communication range with its operating base station. 
The struggle is to be able to cover all the ground targets while complying with those limitations, and to find an optimal algorithm that will use the minimum amount of base stations.

### **Environment Setup:**
1. Download OMNeT++
2. Install the inet library
3. Open a new C/C++ project in OMNeT++
4. Build and run the files here that are attached to this project.

   a. NED files.
   
   b. INI file.
   
   c. cc file of components.
   
   d. h file of components.
